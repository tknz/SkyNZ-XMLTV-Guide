# SkyNZ-XMLTV-Guide
XMLTV Guide for SkyNZ Pulled from the air waves

I built this to integrate TVHeadend with Plex via TVH Proxy. TVHeadend did a pretty terrible job of grabbing the EPG and it had non ASCII characters to top things off.

There is a script that runs to clean up the XML file and then pushes it to GIT where plex consumes it for DVR.
